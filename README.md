Overview

This is a memory game using React. The application is divided into multiple components, and rendered in App.js. The user is given 12 images, and asked to click one. The user's score is increased by 1, and the images reshuffle. The goal is to not click the same image twice. If the user clicks an image more than once, the user looses, the score is reset to 0, and the game starts over. If the user manages to click all 12 images only one, the user wins!
